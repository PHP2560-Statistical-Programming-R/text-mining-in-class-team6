-----Instructions for Trump's Twitter Analysis, Completed by Ozan Adiguzel + Fuyu Zou -------

We did analysis of Twitter of Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump. Each one of us used different methods to get the results and we keep them seperately in two folders.

The knitted output file should generate in the same folder and will be called text-mining-Fuyu1.html or paper.Rmd
